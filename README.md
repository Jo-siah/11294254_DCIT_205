<h3>lesson learned</h3>
<p>As far as this project is concerned , I learned to remain consistent in building projects as there will always be problems that come in the form of bugs and errors. As such consistency and focus is the key. More specifically , I learned to structure web pages properly and feed webpages with the right layout. I look forward to become to good and expert web developer with time</p>
